In this project im creating the library <a href='https://reactrouter.com/en/main'>React Router</a> from scratch with React, this made library is going to be published by npm so anyone who want can install it and import it in his projects.

Also im adding Tests and the '<a href='https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link'>&lt;Link&gt;</a>' component to perform SPA (Single Page Application).
